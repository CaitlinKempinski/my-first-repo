My final project will be a portfolio web site where I can display the work I have done at my internships, in my classes, and in PRSSA.  The web site will also deomonstrate the skills I learned in this class.  I will base the web site around a more personal view of myself and include photos of my hometown and a bio section. There will be tabs for my resume, internships, reccomendations, contact, and about me.  Within the resume tab I will include a my resume.  Witing the internship tab I will have a drop down list of everywhere I have interned.  By clicking on each place, the viewer will be able to see what I did at that specific internship.  Under the reccomendation I will include the letters of reccomendation I have received.  In the contact menu I will have links to my social media accounts as well as my email and phone number.  In the about me section, I will include a brief description of myself and my future goals.
